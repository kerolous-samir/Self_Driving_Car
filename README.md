# Self-Driving Car Project

This project simulates a **self-driving car** using **deep reinforcement learning** and **Kivy** for visualization.

## Features
- **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**: Trains the car to navigate using reinforcement learning.
- **Simulation with Kivy**: Provides a graphical interface to visualize the car's movement.
- **Neural Network with PyTorch**: Handles decision-making for the self-driving car.
- **Experience Replay Memory**: Improves training efficiency.
